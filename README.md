# Using Deep Learning to Predict the Outcome of a Counter-Strike 2 Round

In this project, we use deep learning to train a model to predict the outcome of a Counter-Strike 2 round at any given time during the round. Any given time is at any instance, or tick during the round given the game state during that instance of time or tick. In Counter-Strike 2 time is measured in discrete intervals of 60 times a second, each instance is called a tick, and given the game state in a tick our model should give a percent chance for each team to win the current round.
